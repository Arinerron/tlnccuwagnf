# another programming language

This is just another programming language I'm making for fun. It's mildly based on [another project I made, PLT](https://github.com/liam4/programming-language-thing) and JavaScript.

It's one of those silly interpret-on-the-go programming languages that don't compile to bytecode. This means it's probably much less efficient than, like, any other programming language.

It's a functional programming language (i.e. functions are first class).

That's about it. If you're interested in running it, you can just clone this repository and use `gulp` (while `cd`'d into the repository obviously).

It doesn't make sense. Please ignore the fact that it doesn't make sense? Also, hide, far, far away from the source code. It might lash out and hurt somebody's brain.
